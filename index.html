<p align='justify'>I am the Co-founder and CTO of Trent AI. I am passionate about building AI systems that improve autonomously and reliably, solving real-world tasks for humans. Previously, I led a research lab at Spotify developing AI for personalized listening experiences and was a machine learning scientist at Amazon, while working with Neil Lawrence. Following my Ph.D. and postdoctoral research in machine learning, I co-founded Interentia Limited, which was later acqui-hired by Amazon.</p>
